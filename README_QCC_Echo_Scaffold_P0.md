## Overview

This repository contains the **QCC Echo Scaffold (P0 Core)** logic kernel, developed under the Oscillatory Coherence Refinement (OCR) framework.

Echo Scaffold is a plug-and-play middleware kernel designed to enhance coherence in quantum circuits under noise, demonstrated with:

- **1024 shots**
- **Depolarizing noise model (p = 0.1)**
- **0.00% entropy leakage**  
- **Deterministic output: `000`**

It is designed for integration with Qiskit-based quantum systems as a **circuit-level stabilization layer.**

## Classification

This release represents a **P0-level coherence middleware kernel**. It is not a full SDK and does not include full-stack deployment support.

**Not a product release.** This kernel is intended for demonstration, licensing preview, and performance benchmarking.

## Symbolic Integration Reference

```python
from echo_scaffold import integrate
qc = QuantumCircuit(3, 3)
# Your prep here
qc = integrate(qc)
```

Note: this structure is symbolic and protected. Full implementation is licensed and not open-source.

## Caution

This kernel is entangled with proprietary timing, gate rhythm, and coherence structures.  
Unauthorized use may result in misalignment or unintended decoherence effects.
